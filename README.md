## General Information
- 

- What is the background of your project?
A company provides a bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis.  They want to leverage linear regression based modeling to predict demand of shared bikes.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available predictor variables. It will be used by the business to understand the effect of multiple variables on shared bike demand.  This will help them in business strategy, inventory management etc.
 

- What is the dataset that is being used?

A dataset providing day wise weather & other parameters along with demand of hired bikes on each day.

File name : day.csv
